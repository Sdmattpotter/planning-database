# Healthy Places Index

The Healthy Places Index is a collection of indicators produced by the Public
Health Alliance of Southern California from a wide variety of data sources to
study social determinants of health. It offers index values for many topics --
about 80 columns -- as well as a weighted aggreate index value, all at the
tract level.

This version of the HPI presents the original file with only one modification: the Tiger format Geoid for tracts has been converted to ACS format.
