# San Diego Planning Database

This project collects, processes and publishes datasets with information linked to tracts, communities and cities in San Diego County. The core of the project is the [Census Planning Database](https://www.census.gov/research/data/planning_database/), with modifications to restrict the data to San Diego County and and make it easier to link in other datasets. 

## Datasets

* [San Diego Planning Database](https://data.sandiegodata.org/dataset/sandiegodata-org-planning-tracts) The San Diego County version of the Census Planning Database
* [Cities, Communities and Tracts](https://data.sandiegodata.org/dataset/sangis-org-communities-2018) Geographic boundaries and link files for cities, communities and tracts in San Diego County.
